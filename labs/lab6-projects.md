Group members present in lab today:

1: Plan
----
1. What is your plan for today, and this week <br/>
1.1 Today: Install neccessary packages and dependencies <br/>
1.2 This week: Applied tricks we find in the literature survey to our UNet Models, including (fixed-point/ static/ dynamic) quantization, depthwise-seperable convolution, knowledge distillation, and fire modules to reduce the memory requirement for running the project. <br/>
1.3 This week: Investigate into bottleneck of inferencing. <br/>
1.4 This week: Define the quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrices for both image quality and inference speed <br/>

2. How will each group member contribute towards this plan?<br/>

2: Execution
----
1. What have you achieved today / this week? Was this more than you had planned to get done? If so, what do you think worked well?
3. Was there anything you had hoped to achieve, but did not? What happened? How did you work to resolve these challenges?
4. What were the contributions of each group member towards all of the above?

3: Next steps
----
