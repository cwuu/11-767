Lab 6: Group work on projects
===
The goal of this lab is for you to make progess on your project, together as a group. You'll set goals and work towards them, and report what you got done, chaellenges you faced, and subsequent plans.


Group name: 1 tsp of sugars and 3 eggs
---
Group members present in lab today: <b>Emily Wuu(cwuu), Raymond Lau(kwunfunl)</b>


1: Plan
----
1. What is your plan for today, and this week <br/>
1.1 Today: Discuss the problems encountered and plan for the next sprint. <br/>
1.2 This week: Bug fix the quantization scheme and fire modules. <br/>
1.3 This week: Based on the results, investigate any other bottleneck of inferencing. <br/>
1.4 This week: Inspect the output and see how the image quality change. Then brainstorm/propose any other new directions. <br/>

2. How will each group member contribute towards this plan?<br/>
Emily:
- Continue the developmen of fire modules.
- Inspect the results and propose any improvements.
- Estimate the memory usage and find any technique that can further applied.
- Investigate any other bottleneck of inferencing.

Raymond:
- Trouble shoot the problem encountered in quantization-aware training
- Find a method to compile Numba on ARM system.
- Inspect the results and propose any improvements.
- Estimate the memory usage and find any technique that can further applied.
- Investigate any other bottleneck of inferencing.

2: Execution
----
1. What have you achieved today / this week? Was this more than you had planned to get done? If so, what do you think worked well?
<br><b>Raymond</b>


<br><b>Emily</b>


2. Was there anything you had hoped to achieve, but did not? What happened? How did you work to resolve these challenges?
<br><br><b>Raymond</b>

<br><br><b>Emily</b><br>


3. What were the contributions of each group member towards all of the above?
<br><b>Ans:</b>Each one of us explored different directions that are helpful for the project. Emily focused on improving the network structure while Raymond focused on quantization and preprocessing steps. We also found and defined different appropriate metrics for the evaluations.
  
3: Next steps
----
1. Are you making sufficient progress towards completing your final project? Explain why or why not. If not, please report how you plan to change the scope and/or focus of your project accordingly.
<br><b>Ans:</b> 
2. Based on your work today / this week, and your answer to (1), what are your group's planned next steps?
 <br><b>Ans:</b> 
 
3. How will each group member contribute towards those steps? 
<br><b>Ans:</b> Raymond and Emily will equally take half of the training and evaluation for the experiments the ablation study. And will discuss and analyze the result together.
